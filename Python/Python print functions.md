We saw in the video that passing arguments in the print function allows you to provide data for the function to use. 
This is similar to the mathematical functions, e.g sin(x) takes the argument x.
Open the file print.py and add a line of code to output in the terminal the string Hello world!

```
print("Hello world!)
```

Python functions may have a number of arguments, which are called positional arguments. 
They are separated by a comma, and their order of insertion dictates how they are called in the function’s code. 
Their order of position is important, and that's where the name positional comes from. We will learn more about arguments later in the course.
Open the file ice_cream.py and add a line of code to output the string I scream for ice cream, by splitting the text in more than one argument 
in the print function.

```
