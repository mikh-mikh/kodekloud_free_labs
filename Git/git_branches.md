      THE FROGS AND THE OX
--------------------------------------------

An Ox came down to a reedy pool to drink. As he splashed heavily into the water, he crushed a young Frog into the mud.

The old Frog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers and sisters what had become of him.

"A great big monster," said one of them, "stepped on little brother with one of his huge feet!"

"Big, was he!" said the old Frog, puffing herself up. "Was he as big as this?"

"Oh, much ....

--------------------------------------------
      THE LIOON AND THE MOUSE
--------------------------------------------

A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paws.

A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion's nose.

Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.

"Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you."

The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.

Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net.

Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring.

The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net.

Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free.

"You laughed when I said I would repay you," said the Mouse. "Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion."sarah (story/frogs-and-ox)$ cat

"Oh, much bigger!" they cried.

The Frog puffed up still more.

"He could not have been bigger than this," she said.

But the little Frogs all declared that the monster was much, much bigger and the old Frog kept puffing herself out more and more until, all at once, she burst.sarah (story/frogs-and-ox)$ git add .
