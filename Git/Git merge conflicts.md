Max and Sarah have been contributing stories. And they are available on the remote repository.

During a meeting the team decides to add an Index file to the repository named story-index.txt which would contain a list of all stories written.
It wasn't clear who would own this task, so Max decides to do it himself üí™ . He creates a file named story-index.txt and adds a list of stories to it. 
Check it out under the /home/max/story-blog directory.

```
max $ cd story-blog/ && ls
fox-and-grapes.txt  frogs-and-ox.txt    lion-and-mouse.txt  story-index.txt
max (master)$
```

## 3 / 12

Let's now stage and commit the story-index.txt file.
Use the message - Add index of stories
Check git commit

```
max (master)$ git branch
* master
max (master)$ git add . && git commit -m "^C
max (master)$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        story-index.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
max (master)$ git add story-index.txt && git commit -m "Add index of stories"
[master b7951aa] Add index of stories
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 story-index.txt
 ```
 
 ## 4 / 12
 
Let's now push the file to the remote repository.
Try with the git push origin master command, and select the response you get

```
max (master)$ git push origin master
To http://git.example.com/sarah/story-blog.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'http://git.example.com/sarah/story-blog.git'

Looks like someone has pushed changes to the remote that needs to be pulled first, before we can push any of our own changes to remote.
Pull the remote changes.
Check merge

```

What was the result of the Pull operation?
Read the last 2 lines of the output of the git pull command.

right answer - "Merge Conflict"

## 8 / 12

We are now in a merge conflict! Looks like there was already a file named story-index.txt on remote. Someone beat us to it! Let's find out who.
Check the log of the origin/master branch to see what was the last commit on the repository and identify who added the story-index.txt file.

```
max (master)$ git log origin/master

```	

right answer - "Sarah" 

## 9 / 12

Looks like Sarah already pushed a version of the file. When we pulled latest changes, 
git tried to merge Max's and Sarah's versions of the story-index.txt file, but was unsuccessful. 
However the local story-index.txt file is updated with changes from both Max and Sarah to allow you to merge manually.

Inspect the file (use vi editor or just cat story-index.txt) and select the most appropriate statement below. 
The first section shows Max's data and the second section shows Sarah's data.

```
max (master)$ cat story-index.txt 
<<<<<<< HEAD
1. The Lion and the Mooose
2. The Frogs and the Ox
3. The Fox and the Grapes
4. The Donkey and the Dog
=======
1. The Lion and the Mouse
2. The Frogs and the Ox
3. The Fox and the Grapes
>>>>>>> 4ec3c5a16ef513d4112c200ba09c502c92e772f8
```

right answer - "Sarah 

## 10 / 12

Looks like both of them were partially wrong. Let's fix the file to remove the errors done by each of them. Let's manually merge changes from both users.
Update the contents of the file (use vi editor) to keep the correct version of the Lion and Mouse story and keep the Donkey and Dog story as well. Remove all the extra lines added by GIT
Check merge

story-index.txt:
```
1. The Lion and the Mouse
2. The Frogs and the Ox
3. The Fox and the Grapes
4. The Donkey and the Dog
```

## 11 / 12

Now that we have made a change, we must now commit it.
Commit the current changes with the message - Resolved merge conflicts and merged story index
Check git commit

```
max (master)$ git add . && git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts and merged story index"
[master 8760fae] Resolved merge conflicts and merged story index
```

## Now that we have merged the changes, everything's clean ‚ú® . We can now push the changes to remote.
Check git push
